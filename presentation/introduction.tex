When baking there is allways one big problem: How long do I have to put it into the oven, so it is done in the middle and not burned from the outside. Or: How can I find out that it is done in the middle from the outside? \\

 In this paper we describe how to tackle this problem. First it sounds sophisticating to model the cake and the baking process with the heat equation. We then solve the resulting partial differential differential equation using finite elements. By this we gain a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) which we can solve with a fitting ODE solver. To find out how to bake a cake we test different boundary conditions and heat settings. Also we give some more details about the thermal properties of cake.
