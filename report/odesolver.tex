\section{\label{sec::odesolver}Solving the ODE}

From equation \ref{eqn::matrixForm} we get a system of $n_D-1$ ordinary differential equation of order 1, where at most the inhomogenious part can be non-linear. So we have to solve an initial value problem (IVP) of the form
\begin{flalign*}
	M\dot{u}=Au+b(t)
\end{flalign*}
on the interval $t\in\left[t_0,t_{max}\right]$ with initial value $u_0=u(t_0)$. The ODE can of course also be written as 
\begin{flalign*}
	\dot{u}=M^{-1}(Au+b(t))
\end{flalign*}
but inverting a matrix of size $(n_D-1)\times(n_D-1)$ would take probably at least $\mathcal{O}(n_D^3)$ \cite{li2009fastsolver} operations so is something that wants to be avoided, since e.g. in our case this would be of order $>10^{12}$. \\
To solve the IVP we implemented four different (one step) solvers, two explicit solvers
\begin{itemize}
	\item Forward Euler
	\item Improved Forward Euler
\end{itemize}
and two implicit solvers
\begin{itemize}
	\item Backwards Euler
	\item Crank-Nicholson
\end{itemize}

For this we implemented
