When baking there is allways one big problem: How long do I have to put it into the oven, so it is done in the middle and not burned from the outside. Or how can I find out that it is done in the middle from the outside? \\

To solve this problem it sounds sophisticating to model the cake and the baking process with the heat equation. In this paper we describe how to tackle this problem. We solve the partial differential differential equation - given by the heat equation - using finite elements. By this we gain a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) which we then solve with a fitting ODE solver. To find out how you have to bake a cake we tested different boundary conditions and heat settings. More detailed physical explanations can be found in section \ref{sec::modelling}.
