When baking there is allways one big problem: How long do I have to put it into the oven, that it is done in the middle and not burned from the outside. Or how can I find out that it is done in the middle from the outside? \\

To solve this problem it sounds sophisticating to model the cake and the baking process in a heat equation and solve the resaulting partial differential equation (PDE). In this paper we want to describe how we tackled this problem. We solve the PDE using finite elements to gain a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) which we then solve with a fitting ODE solver. To find out how you have to bake a cake we tested different boundary conditions and heat settings. More detailed physical explanations can be found in the last section.

% In this project, we modelled the baking process of a cake in the oven. Starting with the heat equation (section \ref{sec::problem}), we will derive a time wise differential equation with the help of finite elements in section \ref{sec::setupSystem}. \dots
