\section{\label{sec::code}Code}

Everything we derived in the previous sections has been implemented in matlab.The program is able to simulate the heat equation, for any given tetrahization. It can handle Neumann and Dirichlet conditions, which can depend on place and time. Also the thermal diffusivity $\alpha$ can be given for every single element separately.
