\section{\label{sec::problem}Problem}
The theoretical problem we want to solve is the heat equation, which is given by:
\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} &= \nabla(\alpha\nabla u)\\
	u(\vec{x},t)|_{\partial\Omega^D} &= u^D\\
	\left.\left( \frac{\partial u(\vec{x},t)}{\partial \nu}\right)\right|_{\partial\Omega^N} &= g\\
	u(\vec{x},t)|_{t=0} &=u_0(\vec{x})
\end{align}
Where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $u(\vec{x},t)$ is the heat function.
	\item $\alpha$ is a constant denoting the thermal diffusivitie.
	\item $\Omega$ is the domain of the problem.
	\item $\partial\Omega^D$ is the part of the boundary with Dirichlet boundary-conditions.
	\item $\partial\Omega^N$ is the part of the boundary with Neumann boundary-conditions.
	\item $\nu$ is the normal vector on the Neumann-boundary.
\end{itemize}
